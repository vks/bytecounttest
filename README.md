# bytecounttest

This uses quickcheck and cargo-fuzz to verify the two implementations offered
by [bytecount]() are compatible. It also includes [Daniel Lemire's C
implementation of newline counting algorithms](https://github.com/lemire/Code-used-on-Daniel-Lemire-s-blog/blob/master/2017/02/14/newlines.c)
and some benchmarks.

## Usage

To run the quickcheck test, use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test`.
To run the benchmarks, use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo bench`. This
will likely fail if your architecture does not support AVX2.
To run the fuzzer, use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo fuzz run fuzzer_script_1`.

## Known issues

Due to LLVM problems, the build script might fail with `SIGILL`.
In that case, try to use a more specific target CPU, e.g.
`RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=skylake"`.

## Example for benchmarks

```
test bench_count               ... bench:          29 ns/iter (+/- 1)
test bench_naive_count         ... bench:         415 ns/iter (+/- 6)
test bench_newlinecount_avx    ... bench:          55 ns/iter (+/- 0)
test bench_newlinecount_avxu   ... bench:          40 ns/iter (+/- 0)
test bench_newlinecount_avxuu  ... bench:          56 ns/iter (+/- 2)
test bench_newlinecount_basic  ... bench:       1,873 ns/iter (+/- 44)
test bench_newlinecount_memchr ... bench:         406 ns/iter (+/- 5)
test bench_newlinecount_swar   ... bench:         365 ns/iter (+/- 7)
```
